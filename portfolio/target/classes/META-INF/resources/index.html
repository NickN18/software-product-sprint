      <h1>Nick's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
          Hey there! If you've found this page, it means you've reached my portfolio. It may not look like much, but it's honest work
        </p>

        <p>
            Here's a link to my <a href = "https://linkedin.com/in/nicolasnoriega" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, if you'd like.
            Also my <a href = "https://github.com/NickN18" target="_blank">Github</a>, where I already have some projects I've worked on and projects I'm currently working on!
        </p>

        <header id="aboutHeader">About Me</header>
        <p>
            My name is Nick (if you haven't seen yet). I'm a sophomore at Arizona State University currently studying Software Engineering, with plans
            to study further into Aerospace applications, which will hopefully allow me work on things like the Perserverance rover and SpaceX's 
            rockets.
